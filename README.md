# Evolutionary Algorithms for Generating Quantum Logic Gate Circuits
## ECM3401 Individual Project

The intention of this project is to explore quantum logic gate circuits for a range of problems (see below) and test the applicability of a genetic programming method, specifically Linear Genetic Programming, to the problem of generating these complex ciruits.

The problems I plan to cover are:
- Toffili gate implementation with single and dual qubit gates
- Quantum Forier Transform for 3 (and 4) qubit systems
- Generalised EPR/Bell pair generation for 3, 4 and 5 qubits


## Literature Review Abstract

Quantum Computing is becoming an enticing area of study, on account of its hypothetical potential for revolutionising the field of computability. Quantum gate circuits utilise quantum phenomena to extend the classical logic gate model, making it exponentially more powerful. Yet, such circuits are significantly harder to comprehend and hence develop. Within the literature, genetic approaches are popular choices for overcoming this problem, having been shown to be very effective to this end. They use strings, trees, or other structures to represent programs; more optimal individuals are produced by “evolving” generations of programs.
